## üîç Workflow Breakdown

### 1. Data Collection
- Acquired dataset from [Kaggle/UCI/Custom source]
- Validated data format and contents
- Stored data in `/data` directory

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Removed duplicates, handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Normalized or scaled numerical features
- Saved cleaned data for modeling

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualized key patterns using Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Identified correlations and potential features
- Documented observations in Jupyter notebooks

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Created new features based on domain knowledge
- Performed dimensionality reduction when necessary
- Selected best features using statistical techniques

### 5. Model Training
- Chose appropriate algorithms (e.g., RandomForest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained multiple models and tuned hyperparameters
- Serialized best-performing model with Joblib/Pickle

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Visualized confusion matrix and ROC-AUC curve
- Compared results of different models

### 7. Deployment
- Built REST API using Flask or FastAPI
- Integrated model into API with prediction endpoint
- Created a web UI using HTML (optional)
- Deployed app locally or to the cloud
